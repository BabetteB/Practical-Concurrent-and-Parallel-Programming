# Practical Concurrent and Parallel Programming Au 24

These notes are based on the material for the course Practical Concurrent and Parallel Programming autumn 2024 at the IT University of Copenhagen.
The notes are partially developed by ChatGPT 4o (used to summarize the reading material) supplied with my own notes from the physical lecture - **hence, i cannot ensure that these notes are always correct**. Moreover, - these are my notes for the course - I am not an expert in the field, so if you are looking for a citation, then you are the wrong place my friend. 
These notes are made public to display my what is my interpretation of the theory.
